### Small Business Hackathon: Leveraging e-commerce to Support Small Business

This work is part of a 3-day Hackathon intended to support Small Business through leveraging e-commerce during the pandemic. We worked in a cross-functional team including 1 data scientist, 2 UX Designers, and 3 Software Engineers. Please see below the details on the problem statement we chose to address focusing on scalability of a small business product / services. 

**Problem Statement**

Small businesses are losing revenue due to lack of online presence and low visibility. We are building a platform that will create exposure and awareness for small businesses through offering end-users subscription to promotions. 

**Data and Analysis Takeaways**

For our analysis, we used two independent dataset on Etsy from 2006-2018 covering variables from number of years the store has been on the platform to the quality of reviews customer has given to a merchant. We found that Etsy data and use case are relevant to our platform and would serve as a proxy for making predictions on customer purchases / store sales because Etsy is a two-sided online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers similar to our platform. We also looked at companies that operate in the subscription space to address questions on customer retention and revenue growth

We cleaned, organized the data and ran regression analysis on the data. Our analysis led us to interesting results that we wanted to share with you. We discovered that Most important features in estimating the store revenue are Number and quality of customer reviews, number of store followers, and active listings. These are four components that small businesses have access to on our platform. 

We've built 6 regression models to predict store sales. Our top performing model was Random Forest with a R2 score of 0.90 and RMSE of 1,818. R2 score implies that the model explains 90% of the variance of the date is hasn’t yet seen.

**Success of the platform**

An important question that we asked ourselves: how will we measure success of the platform?
Because We focus on automating the journey for our member-businesses and customers through simplified e-commerce tools, we will be able to track store sales data (previously unavailable to retailers) and customer review metrics. We will have the tools to provide insights on store foot traffic and promotions, so that, the businesses are equipped to make well-informed data driven decisions. Growing network of small businesses will be key. 

#### Creating Community of Local Businesses

“Main Street is the heart of a community”

At MainStreet, we’ve built a community of small independent businesses by creating “Strategic Alliances” between businesses in order to offer their products and services to a wider customer base. We focus on automating the journey for our member-businesses and customers through simplified e-commerce tools. Our goal is to increase visibility for small businesses by strengthening their bond with their communities. 

We provide a platform for small businesses to grow their sales and scale their product, while offering our customers exclusive access to promotions and deals. Our focus is driving customer subscription frequency and retention. We create synergies between our member-businesses and customers as they know that the subscriptions directly support their favorite local small businesses.
