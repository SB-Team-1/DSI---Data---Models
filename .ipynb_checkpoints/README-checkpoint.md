### Small Business Hackathon 

**Problem Statement**

Small businesses are losing revenue due to lack of online presence and low visibility. We are building a platform that will create exposure and awareness for small businesses through offering end-users subscription to promotions. 

#### Creating Community of Local Businesses

“Main Street is the heart of a community”

At MainStreet, we’ve built a community of small independent businesses by creating “Strategic Alliances” between businesses in order to offer their products and services to a wider customer base. We focus on automating the journey for our member-businesses and customers through simplified e-commerce tools. Our goal is to increase visibility for small businesses by strengthening their bond with their communities. 

We provide a platform for small businesses to grow their sales and scale their product, while offering our customers exclusive access to promotions and deals. Our focus is driving customer subscription frequency and retention. We create synergies between our member-businesses and customers as they know that the subscriptions directly support their favorite local small businesses. 

We have a team of data scientists who are all about making data-driven decisions and providing tailored insights on foot traffic and promotions to businesses. We built complex models to identify what components are most impactful in driving the revenue and customer retention. Our algorithms have proven that modernized marketplaces like our platform not only work, but are successful. At MainStreet, the small business community is our priority!
